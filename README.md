# Project 2: Reception Robot
"**Reception Robot**" project, is a robot for receiving and serving customers, as well as recording the extent of customer satisfaction.

In this project, we will build a service **chatbot** by using **IBM Watson Assistant** (It is a service provided by IBM that allows you to create a free chatbot for 30 days).

## Chatbot
A chatbot is a support system for your customer service. Using artificial intelligence and natural language processing, a chatbot can simulate a conversation with a user through messaging apps, websites, mobile apps, and more, giving them accurate and relevant information.

## IBM Watson Assistant

IBM Watson Assistant is an AI-powered virtual agent that gives customers fast, consistent, and accurate answers across any messaging platform, application, device, or channel. Using AI and natural language processing, Watson Assistant learns from customer conversations, improving its ability to resolve issues, while removing the frustration of long wait times, tedious searches, and unhelpful chatbots.

The chatbot will use three main components to determine how to interpret the user input and how to respond to it.
* Intent, which is the purpose or goal of the user's words.
* Entities, which allow us to capture specific values within the user utterance.
* Dialog, allows us to respond to the user based on their intent and values specified by the entities.

## My chatbot using IBM Watson assistant (Ka)
My little chatbot can recommend you a book, movie, or even a place. It also tells jokes but I don't advise you to try to ask about that.
